### Hi there üëã

I specialize in Inventive Design, focusing on machines, vehicles, and devices. My expertise spans several areas:

üéì PhD in Design for Modularity: Developed a method used to design a market-successful family of car trailers
üçÉ Eco-design: Experienced in sustainable energy systems
üí° Inventive Design: Skilled in creating innovative solutions for machines, vehicles, and devices
üèÜ Certified TRIZ Specialist: Actively contributing to the development of Systematic Innovation tools and methods
ü§ñ AI in Engineering: Researching the integration of AI with Systematic Innovation to enhance inventive design and problem-solving skills
üë®‚Äçüè´ Education: Broad experience in teaching engineering design and problem-solving skills to students and PhD candidates

Currently, I'm exploring the exciting intersection of üí° Inventive Design, ü§ñ AI, and Systematic Innovation. I aim to leverage cutting-edge AI technologies like LLMs, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning to push the boundaries of engineering design and problem-solving.
I'm always open to collaborations and discussions in these areas. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in AI-powered inventive design or if you have any questions about TRIZ and Systematic Innovation!
