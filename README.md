### Hi there 👋

I specialize in Inventive Design, focusing on machines, vehicles, and devices. My expertise spans several areas:
  
- 🎓 **PhD in Design for Modularity**: Developed a method used to design a market-successful family of car trailers.  
- 🍃 **Eco-design**: Experienced in sustainable energy systems.  
- 💡 **Inventive Design**: Skilled in creating innovative solutions for machines, vehicles, and devices.  
- 🏆 **Certified TRIZ Specialist**: Actively contributing to developing Systematic Innovation tools and methods.  
- 🤖 **AI in Engineering**: Researching the integration of AI with the Systematic Innovation Toolkit.  
- 👨‍🏫 **Education**: Broad experience in teaching engineering design and problem-solving skills to students and PhD candidates.  
  
Currently, I'm exploring the exciting intersection of 💡 Inventive Design, 🤖 AI, and Systematic Innovation. I aim to leverage cutting-edge AI technologies like LLMs, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning to push the boundaries of engineering design and problem-solving. I'm always open to collaborations and discussions in these areas. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in AI-powered inventive design or if you have any questions about TRIZ and Systematic Innovation!
